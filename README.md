## Getting Started
Before installing the style, make sure you have installed the user style manager extension to your browser, such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) (recommended) or Stylish.

After adding the extension to your browser, you can now install the style. There are two options:

### I. Download from userstyles.org

### II. Manual installation
Here's an example of how to manually install the style to your browser with Stylus. Firstly, go to Tumblr and click the Stylus icon on the toolbar. When the dropdown menu appears, click "Manage".
